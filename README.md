Experimental Flesh and Blood enemy engine, that is able to sample random generated decks based on certain strategies and
determine the "optimal" moves for each hand in order to provide a quasi-human enemy experience / a practice dummy whatever. 

For now the missing arsenal is simply addressed by intellect 5 for the enemy.

Playing manual:

1. Run the main.py file to start

2. The enemy starts defending, the player attacks first

3. Enter your attack value in the box and press SPACE to get the blocking move of the enemy

5. If you choose to not attack any further or there are no more blocks possible, 
    press RETURN to change the enemy stance to attacking
    
6. Press SPACE to trigger the next enemy attack

7. And so on
